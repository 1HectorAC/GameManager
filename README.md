# Game Manager

## Description

This is a website to see how a user spends and plays video games. Once registered and signed in the user will have a games list that they can add, delete, and edit games. After games are entered they can view different report pages to see stats about the users games.

## Requirements

This website was done with C# using ASP.NET on Visual Studio (I used 2017 version of VS). You will also a need to use SQL server. There is an "up.sql" file you need to run to setup the database.
